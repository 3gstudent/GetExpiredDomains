# GetExpiredDomains

Author: 3gstudent

License: BSD 3-Clause

Search for available domain from [expireddomains.net](https://www.expireddomains.net/)

Use GetExpiredDomains.py to get all the 550 results.

Noteï¼š

  Unregistered users can only get 550 results.


### Why write it:

In my test,[CatMyFish.py](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/CatMyFish) can't get all the results from expireddomains.net.
